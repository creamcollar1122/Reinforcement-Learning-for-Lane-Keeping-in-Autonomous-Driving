# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Lane-Keeping-in-Autonomous-Driving
Students will implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to simulate lane-keeping for autonomous driving using a simple 2D simulation environment. The agent will learn to stay within the lane boundaries by optimizing its actions based on rewards.
